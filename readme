Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, it is not possible because assert can only check expressions or
evalutations for if it is valid or not and not memory. Also, C does 
not store the size of an allocated array on runtime which means we 
cannot store array sizes so we cannot keep track of the needed memory
area. Therefore, we cannot see how much space remains when we are 
running Str_copy or Str_concat.
